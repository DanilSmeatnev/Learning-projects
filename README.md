# Learning-projects
Python implementation of process mining and machine learning algorithm 

# Process Mining
Correct implementation of the alpha and Alpha plus algorithm , this implementation take as input csv files that contain traces , 
and give as output a petri-net that is generated by graphviz and snakes plugins

# Machine learning

Python implementation of multivariate linear regression and logistic regression using gradient descent and conjugate gradient descent , 
tested with  notmnist datasets and the mnist datasets and having an accuracy of more than 91%.
