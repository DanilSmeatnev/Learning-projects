'''
Python implementation of machine learning algorithm , this set of classes and function implement a various of method
to make unspervised or supervised learning , from linear-regression to convolutional neural network , these modules
interact with a rest api to create modele easily through a single page application made with angular js , these modules
consist of an easy implementation of algorithm made with pure python and numpy and other implementation using tensorflow
and spark 

Using this toolkit help you to fastly , upload your data , clean it , choose your model , and improve it through monitoring through
techniques and other metric to fit perfectly your model with your data , and made prediction
